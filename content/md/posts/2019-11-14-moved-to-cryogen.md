I decided to switch from Jekyll to [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org) in producing this static site blog.

This is more of a test than an announcement, just to make sure feeds and such work.

Maybe I'll get back to writing more frequently.
The tech is a bit closer to what I use everyday.
It should look basically the same on the outside but is different on the inside.
