Yesterday was my wife's birthday and this happened.

Years ago I made a Twitter account called `@bretlovesanita` just to serve as place to memorialize sentiments that, in earlier times, would be carved into trees or passed as notes while the teacher wasn't looking.
Before heading to church I made a post that said [Happy Birthday to the most beautiful girl in the world](https://twitter.com/bretlovesanita/status/1566418698323349504).

After writing and posting that it hit me, _wasn't there an old song called The Most Beautiful Girl In The World? ... Charlie Rich ... I think ... not sure_.

Anyway, I gathered my things to get going (I have to get there early so we drive separately), got in the car, and start backing out of the garage.
A tune is coming to me _... hey, did you happen to see, the most beautiful ..._
And I'm thinking _I'll have to look that song up later_.

Now, no matter what station is set on the radio, I turn it to the [Real Jazz](https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/real-jazz) channel on Sunday mornings.
I just want music, no words, which is mostly what I get on the Real Jazz channel. I head out of the driveway and hit the preset for the channel.

Driving and listening, we are between tunes and the DJ mentions [Joey DeFrancesco](https://www.joeydefrancesco.com) who had recently died.
It was clear that they were playing a bunch of his music as a tribute but I didn't really hear the details of what was being said.
Then they played one of the tunes he recorded with Jack McDuff, [The Most Beautiful Girl In The World](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-most-beautiful-girl-in-the-world/1443260863?i=1443260960)

_really? ... REALLY?_

(Ok, I know now this was the 1935 show tune, that I do happen to have on Frank Sinatra's Strangers In The Night album, and not the similarly titled song that was sung by Charlie Rich. But my Twitter post wasn't based on any song, just the sentiment alone. Back to my thoughts.)

_wow! ... really_

What does this mean? I do not know. Maybe a little wink from God. I don't really have to know. Whatever it means, it means at least this.

It is ok to say to your wife, _"Happy Birthday to the most beautiful girl in the world"_.
