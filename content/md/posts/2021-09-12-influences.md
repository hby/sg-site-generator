I'm on my Sunday dinner-time drive to get burritos, top down, listening to [Real Jazz](https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/real-jazz) on SiriusXM.
The Marcus Miller show is on and James Brown's _Cold Sweat_ finishes playing.
Miller then says to listen to this and plays the horn line from _So What_.

Check this out at 0:50.

Now, I am pretty familiar with _Kind of Blue_. I have played it a lot. A. Lot. But I still didn't see where Miller was going.

Then he plays just the horn line again from _Cold Sweat_. Now I couldn't unhear it. It was clearly the same line, only funkier.

You can hear it right at the start.

Later, after burritos and a litte listening, I found this.

[James Brown's Cold Sweat Meets Miles Davis's So What: The Jazz Soul of James Brown](https://thedreamvariation.blogspot.com/2013/05/james-browns-cold-sweat-meets-miles.html)

Seems it's real. Neat.
